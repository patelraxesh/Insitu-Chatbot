This is a prototype of a SMS based chatbot that was developed to enable an automatic order placement, order status and reminder information exchange between Vendors and theri Customers. An SMS based interface can be used to ask questions, place orders, get order status and also for mailing and getting invoices.

The same feature can also be used using a slack channel which would also give a realtime information on a MAP showing where the orders are currently.

We used webhooks at most of the places to enable this features.
